\begin{frame}[t]{Multics}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Multics has influenced all modern operating systems that started in 1964
      \item An operating system(OS) written on "Assembly language"
      \item Multics OS Project(Under Bell Labs \& MIT) - can run multiple programme at the same time(Multiplexed)
      \item Ken Thompson and Dannis Ritchie and others
       
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[t]{UNIX}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Ken Thompson and Dannis Ritchie get FRUSTRATED and BORED in the Multics OS project
		\item In the spare time they created a alternative programme (Uniplexed - Unics - UNIX) 
		\item An operating system(OS) written on C
		 
		\item AT\&T licensed it(only source code) in late 1970 and sold it as a commercial product from 1980s as "System V" because of some legal problem with the company.
		\item NOT FREE
	
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{UNIX}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Between 1970-1980 AT\&T used to sold source code only to the universities
		\item Studied at the University of Helsinki(Finland) 
		\item Dedicated to make a OS in the final year project by molding UNIX ( remove some complexity and add some features to it.); BUT GOT BANNED
		
		
		
		
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{GNU project}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Free software, mass collaboration project that was introduced by Richard Stallman under "GNU General Public License"
		
		\item Free as in freedom

		The term “free software” is sometimes misunderstood—it has nothing to do with price. It is about freedom. Here, therefore, is the definition of free software.
		
		\item By the early 1990s, many of the programs required in an operating system (such as libraries, compilers, text editors, a Unix shell, and a windowing system) were completed, although low-level elements such as device drivers, daemons, and the kernel, called GNU Hurd, were stalled and incomplete.
		
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[t]{Linux}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Linus Torvalds principal developer of the Linux kernel, which is the kernel for GNU/Linux operating systems (distributions)
		
		\item The first prototypes of Linux were publicly released later in 1991.
		\item Dosen't use the source code of Unix but it uses the same philosophy;
		
		So Linux is "Unix LIKE not Unix CLONE"
		
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[t]{Linux Distros}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Ubuntu 
		\item Red Hat Enterprise Linux(Paid) - Bug fix, Support, Training
		\item Fedora
		\item Gubuntu
		\item Android
		
	\end{itemize}
